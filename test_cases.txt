if you have a large numbet of philos like 100 (even number) no one should die for such situatuon:
500 200 200
if you have large numver of philos but in odd numbers, like 151 philos, no one should die with this condition:
700 200 200
and if the sleep time is less than the eat time, if your code is good no one should die but has never happened
like: 10 400 200 100
